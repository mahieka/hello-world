# hello-world
The beginning of my DS journey :) 
I have to admit I have been a poor student of data and computer science in the past, and this is part of my conscious effort to develop on my skills and grow out of my aversion to the field. 
I hope to be looking back at this in a few years, with a far greater knowledge of the field and freedom from the shackles of my mental aversion and the subtle idea that I am not "built for this" or analytical enough, simply because I have no prior exposure to the field. 
I might be a romantic and creative individual, but I certainly do not want that to be so engrained in my own idea of self that I simply do not allow myself to explore and excel in the more analytical fields. 
I will also confess here that I pursued python and sql programming courses in the past because I wanted to fill my resume. I have now realised that that was a futile attempt at feeling accomplished, as I now feel even dumber than before I half assed my way through a course that I cannot remember - because I now have certificates that I cannot justify.
I now want to learn, to know more than to show.

I commit to changing myself.
